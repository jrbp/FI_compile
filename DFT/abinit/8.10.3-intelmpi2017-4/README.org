#+TITLE: ABINIT 8.10.3 intelmpi2017-4

Guide for compiling abinit for use with rusty or popeye systems.

* Dependencies
** preinstalled
We will use the preinstalled modules:
    - intel/compiler/2017-4
    - intel/mpi/2017-4
    - intel/mkl/2017-4
    - lib/hdf5/1.12.0-intelmpi
** to be installed manually
*** [[../../../libs/netcdf/4.7.4-intelmpi2017-4/README.org][netcdf/4.7.4-intelmpi2017-4]]
If netcdf with MPI-IO is not needed this can be skipped and either the fallback or preinstalled modules can be used.
However, this guide is written as if parallel netcdf has been installed and a personal module configured as detailed in the link above.
