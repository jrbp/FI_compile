#+TITLE: FI_compile

Guides for compiling certain software and dependencies for use on rusty and/or popeye.

Pull requests for other codes are appreciated. While I've made the abinit
documentation somewhat nice, if all you want to add is a text file with some
copy pasted commands that is better than no documentation at all.

/Well, that just sounds like a package manager with extra steps./
